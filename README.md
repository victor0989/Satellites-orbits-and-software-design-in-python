Satellites-orbits and software design in python: This is a small project based on Mission solver structure and aerospace for software and programming systems for satellites.

Energy networks are really a fancy name for your propulsion system. The reason we call them a network rather than “engine” or the like is that it encompasses far more than that. These “energy networks” are the complex systems that future aircraft will incorporate that can reduce or eliminate fuel burn. For example if you have a hybrid gas-electric aircraft you don’t have just an engine. You have an engine, a motor, batteries, a generator, a gearbox, a propeller or ducted fan, wiring, electronics… and that doesn’t include the parts inside the internal combustion engine. Modeling these systems completely is essential in designing such a vehicle.
